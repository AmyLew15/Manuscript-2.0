            <h2>Reading Response</h2>
            <h3>By Amy Lewis</h3>
                <article>
                <p class="response">The article “There is No Such Thing as Neutral Graphic Design” dives into what defines normal and the default approaches to user friendly design. What comes with that also brings other ideas to consider. First, how do we define normal and what puts that definition into place? Second, as designers, how do we consider what is happening in the world to shift design practices to be more inclusive? At the time when this article was written in 2021, there were a lot of conversations happening particularly in the U.S. about racism, the Covid 19 pandemic, and political structures that were shaping how the country was handling important issues.</p>
                <blockquote class="response">This article speaks to that pivotal moment and encourages designers to use their craft in times of resistance as a tool for change.</blockquote>
                <p class="response">The authors of this article provided thought provoking examples of when designers, writers, and other creatives of the past took matters into their own hands to shape how we approach design today. In interaction design specifically, this idea rings true to how designers develop the digital spaces where so much discourse about the world occurs.</p>
                <blockquote class="response">Designers hold a responsibility to create spaces that can be a vessel for the good, the bad, and the ugly that allow for societal course correction when it is needed most.</blockquote>
                <p class="response">As a designer myself and growing up in tandem with digital spaces, I am encouraged but also believe it is necessary to look at current events to inform my own work. I think this article articulated very well the perspective of how as a designer, what I bring to the table in my own biases, experiences, and preferences matters. I believe design is truly a collaborative profession and that the best design comes from the voices, ideas, and structures that break the status quo.</p>
